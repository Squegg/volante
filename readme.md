# ShopHub

ShopHub aims to become the one stop shop for creating a webshop.
With ShopHub, anyone can start a webshop in no time, self hosted with a ShopHub API connector, or hosted by ShopHub.
Products can easily be added to the stores from different manufacturers.
Upon a sale, the product will immedinately be sent from the manufacturer to the customer.

This way, worrying about stock and investments is not needed anymore, and manufacturers have a new business model.

Besides the connectors to enable 3th party webshop's (for example Magento) to integrate with ShopHub, connectors will be made to integrate ShopHub with the manufacturers' backend systems like SAP / Navision.

Feel free to fork & help!
